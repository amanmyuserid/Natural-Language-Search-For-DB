# Natural-Language-Search-For-DB

## 1. Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end solution for converting natural language queries into SQL using an LLM. It integrates SQL injection validation and vector-based semantic search (using pgvector) to execute and retrieve data from a PostgreSQL database. A Streamlit UI provides an interactive interface for users to enter queries and view results.

## 2. Project Description

- **LLM-based SQL Query Generation:**  
  Converts user queries into SQL. The system supports pure SQL queries, vector similarity search queries, and hybrid queries that combine both methods.

- **SQL Injection Validation:**  
  A dedicated module checks generated SQL queries for potential injection vulnerabilities, ensuring that only safe queries are executed.

- **Vector Search with pgvector:**  
  Uses pgvector to store text embeddings and perform semantic similarity searches, improving query accuracy.

- **Streamlit UI:**  
  Provides a user-friendly web interface where users can enter natural language queries and view results in real time.

## 3. How to Run It

### Prerequisite
- **Docker** must be installed on your system.

### Running the Project

The project is fully Dockerized for easy deployment. To run the application, simply execute:

```bash
docker run -p 8501:8501 amanmyuserid/natural-language-search:latest
```

After running the command, open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8501/
```

You will see the Streamlit UI where you can enter a natural language query to interact with the database.

Each component is modular, ensuring that the code is easy to maintain, test, and extend.

## 5. Suggestions for Improving System Effectiveness

- **Advanced Prompt Engineering & Candidate Selection:**  
  Enhance the LLM prompt instructions to generate multiple candidate SQL queries, then implement a selection mechanism (e.g., voting or ranking) to choose the best, most robust query.

- **Caching & Pre-computation:**  
  Implement caching for frequently executed queries and pre-compute embeddings for common text (like popular product names) to reduce latency and lower system load.

- **Indexing & Query Optimization:**  
  Optimize the PostgreSQL database by using specialized indexing strategies (e.g., HNSW indexes for vector search) and employ `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to fine-tune query performance on large datasets.

- **Enhanced Validation & Security Layers:**  
  Integrate additional static analysis rules and a confirmation step for destructive operations (e.g., DELETE) to prevent accidental data loss.

- **Logging, Monitoring & Feedback Loop:**  
  Set up detailed logging for generated queries, execution times, and validation results. Use monitoring tools to track performance and establish a feedback loop to continuously refine prompt design and overall system configuration.
